## Description

Just a fairly simple REACT portfolio that hopefully gets a good grade and maybe someday some work

## Link
You can find the live site deployed on netlify right [here!](https://65b72338f4e8dee0088c3243--transcendent-kulfi-239f48.netlify.app)

## Features

- Uses react to switch what is displayed on landing page to what the user has selected
- Uses react icons to link to websites to my various skills I have learned(color coded as well for fun)
- Uses react icons to link to my github profile and linkedin
- Has a contact page that takes checks to see if the field are entered in "correctly" then when everything checks out sends a message below the form that says "Thanks (inputName), I will get back to you when I have some time and we can discuss your project!"
- Also MOSTLY optimized for mobile viewing as well, a few hiccups in there with extra smaller screens I will get fixed but overall very happy with the layout on other screen sizes.
- On a smaller screen the header will turn into an icon you can click to open up an overlay with the header navigation options, upon clicking one will close the overlay and switch what is displayed.

## References
Used a video from [TubeGuruji](https://www.youtube.com/@tubeguruji) to get a decent start on the layout, I wanted to use tailwind and was still a bit confused on some aspects of REACT.  [This]([https://www.youtube.com/@tubeguruji](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KETD93OnAVs)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KETD93OnAVs) is the link to that video.
